# üöÄ SQL & PostgreSQL: A Developer's Deep Dive

Welcome to my learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey as I explore the world of databases, starting with the fundamentals of SQL and moving into the advanced features of PostgreSQL.

## üéØ About This Project

The goal of this repository is not just to store notes, but to build a structured, hands-on portfolio of my skills in database management. I'll be tackling everything from basic queries to complex database design and performance tuning.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This is my planned curriculum. I'll be checking off topics as I master them and adding my notes and code examples to this repository.

### ‚Ö†. SQL Fundamentals

* [ ] **Data Query Language (DQL):**
  * [ ] `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
  * [ ] `ORDER BY` & `LIMIT`
  * [ ] `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`
  * [ ] `DISTINCT`
* [ ] **Joining Tables:**
  * [ ] `INNER JOIN`
  * [ ] `LEFT JOIN` & `RIGHT JOIN`
  * [ ] `FULL OUTER JOIN`
  * [ ] `UNION` vs `UNION ALL`
* [ ] **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
  * [ ] `CREATE TABLE`
  * [ ] `ALTER TABLE` (ADD, DROP, MODIFY COLUMN)
  * [ ] `DROP TABLE`
* [ ] **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
  * [ ] `INSERT INTO`
  * [ ] `UPDATE`
  * [ ] `DELETE`
* [ ] **Core Concepts:**
  * [ ] Primary Keys & Foreign Keys
  * [ ] Constraints (`NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`)

### ‚Ö°. Advanced SQL

* [ ] Subqueries (Scalar, Multi-row, Correlated)
* [ ] Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* [ ] Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`)
* [ ] `CASE` Statements
* [ ] Transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)
* [ ] Views

### ‚Ö¢. PostgreSQL Essentials

* [ ] Installation & Setup (Docker & Local)
* [ ] The `psql` Command-Line Interface
* [ ] **PostgreSQL Data Types:**
  * [ ] `SERIAL` vs `UUID` for Primary Keys
  * [ ] `JSON` & `JSONB`
  * [ ] `ARRAY`
  * [ ] `TIMESTAMP` vs `TIMESTAMPTZ`
* [ ] User Roles & Permissions (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`)

### ‚Ö£. Advanced PostgreSQL

* [ ] Indexing & Performance Tuning (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`)
* [ ] Stored Procedures & Functions
* [ ] Triggers
* [ ] PostgreSQL Extensions (e.g., PostGIS, pg_crypto)
* [ ] Database Backup & Restore
